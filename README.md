Minifetch is a minimalistic command-line system information tool written in `bash 3.2+`. Minifetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in a minimalistic, aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of Minifetch is to be used in screen-shots of your system. Minifetch shows the most important information other people want to see. There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.

The information by default is displayed alongside a small arch linux logo. (Hey, it looks good, okay?)

You can further configure Minifetch to display exactly what you want it to. Through the use of command-line flags and the configuration file you can change existing information outputs or add your own custom ones.
